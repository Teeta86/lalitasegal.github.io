Hi! My name is Lalita. Welcome to my blog! I am learning how to code and I am using VSCode, GitHub and Hugo to build this website. I use a mac and my focus points right now are Python, VSCode, Xcode, GitHub and learning through tutorial videos, AI and more! 
My goal right now is to become proficient in coding so I can build apps and websites. I am utilizing AI to help me along the way, but I want to know how coding works so I understand what is happening to my code. Join me in my journey!
