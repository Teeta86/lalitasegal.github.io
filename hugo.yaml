      I am a code enthusiast starting my journey learning computer language. My hope is to start a new career building apps, delve in data management, computer science and more. Take a look at my blog and projects to see what I've been working on! 

      I am currently working on a navigation app built specially for motorcyclists so it can better help them navigate. Integrated into the app will be, tracking your route, turn by turn directions, waypoints, weather (realtime while traveling), elevation, wind, sharing and more!
